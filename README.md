## 1. Summary

This project is a single-page web application generated to fulfill the following brief:

> Your assigned company: AES Corporation (AES), CIK 0000874761.

Fetch https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK0000874761/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json (set a descriptive User-Agent per SEC guidance).
Read `.entityName`. Filter `.units.shares[]` for entries whose `fy` > "2020" and
includes a numeric `val`.
Save `data.json` with this structure:
`{"entityName": "AES Corporation", "max": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}, "min": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}}`
where `max` and `min` refer to the highest and lowest `.val`. Break ties however you like.

Render a visually appealing `index.html` where:
- `<title>` and `<h1>` must include the live `entityName`.
- The max/min figures are clearly marked with these IDs:
  `share-entity-name`,
  `share-max-value`, `share-max-fy`,
  `share-min-value`, `share-min-fy`.

If the page is opened as `index.html?CIK=0001018724` (or any other 10-digit CIK),
`fetch()` from the SEC endpoint for that CIK using any proxy, e.g. AIPipe,
replace every ID listed above and the title and H1 without reloading the page.

Also commit the attachment uid.txt as-is.

This application was built and deployed automatically as part of a multi-round, automated evaluation task for **Round 1**. The entire frontend is self-contained within the `index.html` file.

## 2. Setup

No local setup is required to run this application. It is designed for direct deployment and viewing on GitHub Pages. All necessary dependencies (such as CSS frameworks or external libraries) are loaded from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

## 3. Usage

To use the application, navigate to the deployed GitHub Pages URL:

[**View the live application here**](https://SrtSaa.github.io/ShareVolume/)

The page will load, and the application will be ready for interaction as described in the summary.

## 4. Code Explanation

The entire application logic, styling, and structure are contained within the `index.html` file.

-   **HTML**: Provides the fundamental structure and content of the page, including forms, buttons, and containers as specified in the brief.
-   **CSS**: Styling is either included within `<style>` tags or loaded from a CDN (e.g., Bootstrap) as required.
-   **JavaScript**: All dynamic functionality, including event handling (e.g., button clicks, user input) and API interactions (`fetch` calls), is handled by plain JavaScript embedded within `<script>` tags.

The code was generated by an LLM to specifically address the project requirements and pass a series of automated checks.
